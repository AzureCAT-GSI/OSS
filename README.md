# Open Source Software on Azure
Microsoft Azure is an open and flexible platform that enables you to run the platform and code that your solution requires.  One in 5 virtual machines on the Microsoft Azure platform use Linux, and Microsoft has openly embraced the open source community by contributing key assets such as the .NET framework and its libraries to the open source community.  Microsoft is a key contributor to open source initiatives and enables the platform that your solution needs regardless if it uses Windows or not.
